|Riot Engine database file format|
+================================+

This file documents the database file format ("SRSC") used by the Riot Game Engine by Surreal Software.

All of the following information has been aquired through reverse engineering. 
Some basic information was taken from a script found at: http://aluigi.altervista.org/bms/drakan.bms.

This document uses a pseudo-C syntax for data structure definitions. You'll figure it out.
    "T[uint16]" refers to an array of T with a uint16 length prefix
    "ref" refers to another resource and is a struct { uint16 id, db_index; }.
    All structs are packed. No alignment padding unless explicitly specified.

PLEASE NOTE: This documentation is not complete. I could not identify all fields used in all files.
Feel free to make a pull request should you find out things not documented here.

This info was compiled by Zalasus and also these people from the arokhslair.net forums:
    BuXXe
    HeckFluff
    UCyborg
(Thanks a lot, guys :D)


How the engine manages it's assets
==================================
    
    The Riot Engine stores all it's assets in database files with a common format. All these files use
    the magic number "SRSC", so that's what we are gonna call the format from now on.
    
    An SRSC file consists of a list of records of which one or more may represent a single game asset.
    Sounds for instance consist of only one record, while models are made up of at least 6 records each.
    
    Assets are managed in so called "databases", defined by a *.db file. The name of that file (without extension) 
    is that database's name. The *.db file is plaintext formatted. More about that file can be found in chapter "Database definition".

    A database's different types of assets are stored in seperate SRSC files stored in the same directory as the defining *.db file.
    The type of asset contained in an SRSC file is identified by it's file extensions.
    These are the possible file extensions and their associated asset types for databases:
    
        *.mod    Models
        *.adb    Character model animations
        *.ssd    "STOMP"-Sequences
        *.odb    Objects
        *.sdb    Sounds
        *.txd    Textures

    Apart from those, the following files are also SRSC formatted, but aren't part of databases:

        *.rrc   Contains various resources like Music; found in engine toplevel
        *.lvl   Contains level geometry, object placements etc. (see lvl_format.txt for a preliminary documentation)


Database definition
===================
    A database is defined by it's *.db file. It is a plaintext file with the structure:
        
        version <version number>
        dependencies <dependency count>
        <index of dependency 1>  <path of dependency 1>
        <index of dependency 2>  <path of dependency 2>
            ...
        <index of dependency n>  <path of dependency n>

    The listed database paths omit the *.db extension and are relative to the location of the current *.db file.
    Note that the given indices aren't necessarily consecutive or start at a given number (e.g. 2,4,6). The only
    rule is that these are 1-based. Index 0 is used to refer to the current database and can not be used for 
    dependencies.
    
    These dependencies are used for internally referencing records. See subchapter "Referencing a record"
    in chapter "Basic SRSC format".


Basic SRSC format
=================

    Data formatting
    ---------------
        All fields are little-endian.

        Strings are plain ASCII, prefixed with a 16-bit length field. Strings with an odd length
        are padded with a single 0 byte. This padding is also included in the length field, so a 
        string length can only ever be even. Strings are not zero-terminated.

        Floats use standard IEEE 754 format, single precision.

   
    File structure
    --------------
        Header:

            uint8[4]    magic = 'SRSC';
            uint16      version = 0x0100; // speculative
            uint32      directory_offset;
            uint16      record_count;

        This is followed by a block containing the record bodies. After that,
        starting at directory_offset one can find a list of all records with pointers to the data area above:

            struct directory_entry
            {
                uint16  record_type;
                uint16  record_id;   // see "Record ID and grouping"
                uint16  group_id;
                uint32  body_offset;
                uint32  body_size;
            }

            directory_entry[record_count]   directory;

            // end of file

        
    Record types
    ------------
        All records have a 16-bit type ID. This type ID determines the structure of the record body.
        See top chapter "Record types" for a list of all known record structures.
        

    Record ID and grouping
    ----------------------
        Most records are identified by an ID, found in the SRSC directory. This is a running number that is
        unique per SRSC file. If a record has no ID, the ID field has a value of 0.

        All asset types except textures allow to collect assets in named groups. These asset types define a special
        record type for group definitions (not the same across different asset types: Classes use 0x0101 while sequences use 0x0313).
        That record's body consists of a single string, which is the groups name.
        The record ID of that group definition record is that group's ID. All records whose directory entry states a group ID
        different than 0 are part of the group with the ID stated. 
        Group definition records can also be part of a group, making them subgroups of the given group. Record that are children of
        those subgroup use the subgroup's ID instead.
        Note that even across groups, all record IDs must be unique, IDs of groups included.

        Grouping seems like it's only use is convenience for the level designer. Group definitions only ever show up in the editor,
        and group IDs are not needed for identifiying a record since record IDs are unique across groups.


    Referencing a record
    --------------------
        Records are referenced by their ID. Since these IDs aren't unique across different SRSC files, all references to other records
        include an index of their database's dependency table. The database found at that index is the one containing the referenced record.
        Note that this index is 1-based, as an index of 0 refers to the current database.

        While IDs also aren't unique across a databases different asset archives, this is not a problem since all references state the type
        of the referenced record either implicitly (e.g. model field in class record) or explicitly (other class fields).

Audio format
============
    Audio data is stored as raw PCM samples (optionally zlib-compressed). It is stored sample after sample without
    any metadata.

    Stereo files are stored interleaved, left channel first.

    8 bit samples are stored unsigned with a bias of 128. 16 bit samples are stored signed.


Texture format
==============
    Textures are encoded as zlib-compressed raw pixels.
    Rows are stored bottom-up from left to right.
    
    The pixel format is selected by the bpp-field in the texture header.
    The following pixel formats have been found:
    
    8 bpp
    -----
        Each pixel is represented by one byte that is an index in the colour palette, found in the 0x0030 record.
        
    
    16 bpp
    ------
        Format depends on the type of alpha map used. If no alpha map is present or it is stored seperately (flag 0x01),
        the following format is used:
            5-6-5-format (note the LE byte order!)
            
            RRRRRGGG GGGBBBBB
             Byte 1   Byte 0
         
            Note that the green channel uses 6 bit while red and blue only use 5.
            
        If the alpha map is integrated into the texture (alpha channel, indicated by flag 0x02),
        the format used is determined by the alpha-bpp-field. The following formats have been found:
        
            ABPP    R:G:B+A bits   Bit pattern (LE adjusted!)
            0       5:6:5+0        RRRRRGGG GGGBBBBB
            1       5:5:5+1        ARRRRRGG GGGBBBBB
            4       4:4:4+4        AAAARRRR GGGGBBBB
            8       3:3:2+8        AAAAAAAA RRRGGGBB
            
        
            
        The 8:8:8+8 is sometimes listed in the editor but reported as "not yet implemented", probably due to the
        fact the 8-alpha-bit setting is already occupied by the 3:3:2+8 format.
        Please note that these formats also use LE encoding.


    24 bpp
    ------
        8-8-8-format

        RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB
         Byte 0   Byte 1   Byte 2
         
        Note that this is not adjusted for any byte order!


    32 bpp
    ------
    
        As written by the editor's 'convert'-function:
        
        RRRRRRRR GGGGGGGG BBBBBBBB XXXXXXXX
         Byte 0   Byte 1   Byte 2   Byte 3
        
        Note that this is not adjusted for any byte order! X is unused, but may be alpha.
        32 bit textures with alpha can't be created using the editor (reports them as being "unimplemented").


Class format
============
    Classes are stored as a set of fields. A class record first contains a short header, then a data area consisting of
    dwords (4 bytes). After that, a list of field definitions is stored. Each definition contains the field's data type and
    the field's name. It is likely that the index of the field definition can be used to identify the field (objects in level
    files, which list only modified fields, explicitly state the index these fields have in their class). Otherwise, a field's
    name is a safe albeit inefficient way to identify it.
    
    Each of the field definitions corresponds to one dword in the data area, in the same order as they appear in the field 
    definition list (so the first field defined would correspond to the first dword at the beginning of the data area).
    
    Some fields, however, may require more than a dword to store their contents. These are namely strings and arrays.
    For this reason, the data area may contain more dwords than the number of fields. In this trailing area, the actual string
    or array data is stored, while the dword at the string's/array's index instead looks like this:
    
        uint16 offset;
        uint16 length;

    Where offset is the offset in dwords starting from the beginning of the data area where the string's/array's data can be found,
    and length is the number of dwords contained in that trailing field. For arrays this is equal to the number of elements contained,
    while strings are packed into as many dwords as required, and then padded with zero bytes if the string's size is not divisible by 4.
    
    Colors are stored as ARGB.
    
    
String decryption
=================
    Strings in 0x402 records can be decrypted using the following alogrithm:
    
        uint32_t key = 0x5FDD390D;
    
        for(size_t i = 0; i < len; ++i)
        {
            str[i] ^= key & 0xFF;
            key = (key<<3) | (key>>(32-3));
        }
        
    (Thanks to UCyborg for figuring this out!)
